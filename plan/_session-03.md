## Claude Instructions - Session 3

### Context
We have methodology phases (Session 1) and framework definitions (Session 2). Now we need working code.

### Your Task for This Session

**Create coherent Python examples** (Component D - Lean-Clean Code Paradigms)

Specifically:
1. Generate a v1 folder structure for Pragmatic CA PoC type
2. Create the "golden example" - the localized campaign generation test
3. Implement enough code to make the test executable (with fakes)
4. Document the coding patterns used

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Working project structure that `pytest` can run
- [ ] One complete feature implemented (campaign generation)
- [ ] Patterns documented for: Orchestrators, Use Cases, Fakes, Adapters

**We'll tackle the Review Guide/Workbook in Session 4.**
