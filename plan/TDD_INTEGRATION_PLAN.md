# TDD Integration Plan for README.md

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY SESSION 01**
>
> This document was created on 2025-10-12, before Session 01 architectural decisions (2025-10-13).
>
> **Session 01 now authoritatively defines:**
> - **PoC types** → See `/plan/_session-01-architectural-decisions.md` Q1 (Steel Thread, Pragmatic CA, Full CA)
> - **pytest approach** → See Session 01 Q3 (pytest with BDD docstrings, not Gherkin)
> - **Phase structure** → See `README.md` (refined with PoC type evolution)
>
> This file remains for TDD integration ideas but **integration should be done using Session 01 architectural decisions as foundation.**

## Overview

This document provides a detailed plan for weaving Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow into each phase of the Lean-Clean methodology (README.md). The integration is optional and triggered by a decision point early in the process.

**Key Principle:** TDD is presented as an **acceleration option for enterprise PoCs**, not a mandatory practice for all PoCs.

---

## High-Level Changes

### 1. Add TDD Decision Point (New Section Before P0)

**Location:** After "⚙️ Phases" table, before "Phase 0: Context Framing"

**Content to Add:**

```markdown
---

## 🎯 TDD Decision Point: When to Use Test-Driven Development

Before starting Phase 0, decide whether this PoC should use Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### ✅ Use TDD When:

- **Multiple stakeholders need alignment** → Tests = executable specifications everyone reviews
- **Enterprise approval process required** → Tests = documentation for governance
- **Complex business rules** → Use case tests capture domain knowledge
- **Expensive external dependencies** (OpenAI, databases) → Fakes enable testing without costs
- **Parallel team development** → Interfaces defined upfront via tests
- **PoC will become production** → Test suite becomes regression suite

### ❌ Skip TDD When:

- **Solo developer, 2-3 day spike** → Too much overhead for throwaway code
- **Purely exploratory PoC** → Don't know requirements yet (spike first, TDD after)
- **Simple CRUD with no business logic** → Overkill for basic operations
- **Stakeholders unavailable for workshop** → Can't co-author specs
- **Deadline is extremely tight** → Cut scope instead

### TDD Workflow Summary:

If using TDD, you'll follow this enhanced workflow:

1. **P1:** Write test scenarios with stakeholders (Given/When/Then)
2. **P3:** Implement with fakes (all tests pass, $0 spent on external services)
3. **P5:** Test scenarios = implementation specs
4. **P6:** Implement real adapters (tests still pass)

**Timeline Impact:**
- **Without TDD:** 2-4 weeks (with multiple rebuild cycles)
- **With TDD:** 1-2 weeks (single build cycle, no rework)

**See:** `plan/TDD_STAKEHOLDER_ACCELERATION_INSIGHTS.md` for detailed analysis

---
```

---

## Phase-by-Phase Integration

### Phase 0: Context Framing

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add TDD-specific outputs

**Current Outputs:**
> Problem statement, success criteria, assumptions.

**Enhanced Outputs:**
> Problem statement, success criteria (testable behaviors), assumptions, **TDD decision (yes/no with rationale)**.

#### 2. Add new activity

**Add to Activities list:**

```markdown
- **TDD Decision:** Evaluate whether this PoC should use TDD (see decision framework above)
  - If YES → Prepare for stakeholder workshop in P1
  - If NO → Continue with traditional approach
```

#### 3. Add to success criteria section

**New subsection:**

```markdown
#### Success Criteria as Testable Behaviors (If Using TDD)

Instead of vague success criteria, define testable behaviors:

**Traditional:**
- ❌ "Generate social media creatives for products"
- ❌ "Support multiple aspect ratios"
- ❌ "Include branding elements"

**TDD-Enhanced:**
- ✅ "Given a brief with 2 products and 3 aspect ratios, generate 6 creative assets"
- ✅ "Each creative includes product image, campaign message, and brand logo"
- ✅ "Reject unsupported aspect ratios with clear error message"

These testable behaviors become your test scenarios in P1.
```

---

### Phase 1: Decomposition

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add new subsection: "Test Scenario Definition"

**Add after "Outputs" section:**

```markdown
#### Test Scenario Definition (TDD Approach)

If using TDD, translate atomic problems into test scenarios:

**Format:** Given/When/Then

**Example:**

| Scenario | Given | When | Then |
|----------|-------|------|------|
| Valid brief generates assets | Brief with 2 products, 3 aspects | Execute generate use case | Returns 6 assets with URLs |
| Invalid aspect rejected | Brief with unsupported aspect "4:3" | Execute generate use case | Raises ValidationError |
| Missing image auto-generated | Brief with product lacking image | Execute generate use case | Generates image from description |

**Stakeholder Workshop:**

If using TDD, schedule a 1-3 hour workshop with stakeholders to:
1. Review decomposition outputs (domain model, I/O map)
2. Co-author test scenarios for each atomic problem
3. Get stakeholder sign-off on test scenarios

**Workshop Output:** Test scenario document (becomes test file skeletons in P3)

**See:** `plan/TDD_STAKEHOLDER_ACCELERATION_INSIGHTS.md` section "Stakeholder Workshop Template"
```

#### 2. Update Outputs

**Current:**
> - Concept map or domain model
> - List of atomic problems / unknowns
> - Initial backlog of experiments

**Enhanced:**
> - Concept map or domain model
> - List of atomic problems / unknowns
> - Initial backlog of experiments
> - **Test scenario document (if using TDD)** ✨

---

### Phase 2: Ideation & Concept Design

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add TDD consideration to architecture evaluation

**Add new subsection:**

```markdown
#### Architectural Requirements for TDD

If using TDD, ensure your architecture includes:

1. **Controllers** - Provide specification layer for stakeholder-readable tests
2. **Ports (Protocols)** - Enable testing with fakes instead of real adapters
3. **Dependency Injection** - Wire fakes in tests, real adapters in production

**Example:**

```python
# Application layer defines port
class ImageGenPort(Protocol):
    def generate_png(self, prompt: str, size: str) -> bytes: ...

# Use case depends on port (not concrete implementation)
class GenerateCreativesUseCase:
    def __init__(self, image_gen: ImageGenPort):
        self.image_gen = image_gen

# Test with fake
class FakeImageGen:
    def generate_png(self, prompt: str, size: str) -> bytes:
        return f"FAKE_{prompt}".encode()

# Production with real adapter
class OpenAIImageGen:
    def generate_png(self, prompt: str, size: str) -> bytes:
        return self.client.images.generate(...).data[0].b64_json
```

**Decision:** If using TDD, prefer **Full Clean Architecture** with controllers over simplified structure.

**See:** `plan/CRITICAL_INSIGHTS.md` section "TDD Revelation: Controllers as Specification Layer"
```

---

### Phase 3: Refinement & Steel Thread Definition

**Changes:**

#### 1. Replace single approach with TDD vs Non-TDD options

**Current section structure:**
> Goal → Activities → Outputs

**Enhanced structure:**

```markdown
### Phase 3: Refinement & Steel Thread Definition

> Cut through to the smallest valuable slice.

**Goal:** Converge on a single minimal viable flow that proves feasibility.

---

#### Option A: TDD Steel Thread (Enterprise PoCs)

**When to use:**
- Multiple stakeholders
- Complex business rules
- Need early validation before expensive implementation

**Activities:**

1. **Write Controller Tests** (with stakeholders if possible)
   - Define API contract tests
   - Mock use cases (don't exist yet)
   - Tests will fail initially (RED phase)

2. **Write Use Case Tests** (with domain experts)
   - Define business logic tests
   - Use fake adapters (no external dependencies)
   - Tests will fail initially (RED phase)

3. **Implement Controllers** (thin orchestration)
   - Convert requests to domain objects
   - Call use cases
   - Handle errors
   - Tests pass! (GREEN phase)

4. **Implement Use Cases with Fakes**
   - Business logic only
   - Use fake adapters (in-memory implementations)
   - Tests pass! (GREEN phase)

5. **Demo to Stakeholders** (CHECKPOINT)
   - Show "working" system using fakes
   - Cost: $0 in API calls
   - Get approval before building expensive adapters

**Outputs:**
- ✅ Passing test suite (controller + use case tests)
- ✅ Working implementation with fakes
- ✅ Stakeholder sign-off on behavior
- ⏳ Real adapters (not built yet - P6)

**Timeline:** 2-3 days

---

#### Option B: Exploratory Steel Thread (Rapid Prototypes)

**When to use:**
- Solo developer
- Unclear requirements
- 2-3 day spike
- Throwaway code

**Activities:**

1. Define the "steel thread" (end-to-end flow)
2. Build minimal implementation directly
3. Test manually
4. Maybe add smoke tests

**Outputs:**
- Working PoC code
- Validation plan
- Acceptance criteria

**Timeline:** 1-2 days

---

#### Decision Matrix

| Factor | TDD (Option A) | Exploratory (Option B) |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Stakeholder alignment needed | ✅ Best choice | ❌ Will need rework |
| Requirements clear | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |
| Requirements unclear | ⚠️ Do spike first | ✅ Best choice |
| Expensive dependencies | ✅ Test with fakes | ❌ Pay as you explore |
| Solo dev, 2-3 days | ❌ Too much overhead | ✅ Best choice |
| Team of 3+ | ✅ Clear contracts | ⚠️ Coordination harder |
| Will become production | ✅ Test suite ready | ❌ Need to add tests |

---
```

---

### Phase 4: Reconstitution & Roadmapping

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add TDD-specific epic

**Add to Activities:**

```markdown
- If using TDD, add "Test Infrastructure" as an epic:
  - Set up test framework (pytest)
  - Create fake adapters for all ports
  - Create entity factories for test data
  - Set up test fixtures and conftest
```

#### 2. Update Outputs

**Current:**
> - Epic breakdown / roadmap
> - Layered architecture outline
> - Updated backlog for future phases

**Enhanced:**
> - Epic breakdown / roadmap **(if TDD: includes Test Infrastructure epic)** ✨
> - Layered architecture outline **(if TDD: includes ports for fakes)** ✨
> - Updated backlog for future phases

---

### Phase 5: Implementation Planning

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add test scenario integration to use-case specs

**Add new subsection after "Development plan with milestones":**

```markdown
#### Use-Case Specs with Test Scenarios (TDD Approach)

If using TDD, enhance YAML use-case specs with test scenario references:

**Example:**

```yaml
use_case: generate_creatives
version: 0.1
inputs:
  - brief: Brief
  - products: List[Product]
  - aspects: List[str]
outputs:
  - assets: List[Asset]

# TDD Enhancement: Link to test scenarios
test_scenarios:
  - name: valid_brief_generates_assets
    given: "brief with 2 products, 3 aspects"
    when: "execute use case"
    then: "returns 6 assets with image URLs"
    test_file: "tests/unit/use_cases/test_generate_creatives.py::test_valid_brief"
    status: approved_by_stakeholder
    approved_date: "2025-10-11"
    approved_by: "jane@acme.com"

  - name: invalid_aspect_raises_error
    given: "brief with invalid aspect '4:3'"
    when: "execute use case"
    then: "raises ValidationError"
    test_file: "tests/unit/use_cases/test_generate_creatives.py::test_invalid_aspect"
    status: approved_by_stakeholder
    approved_date: "2025-10-11"
    approved_by: "jane@acme.com"

  - name: missing_image_auto_generated
    given: "brief with product lacking image"
    when: "execute use case"
    then: "generates image from description and caches"
    test_file: "tests/unit/use_cases/test_generate_creatives.py::test_auto_generate"
    status: approved_by_stakeholder
    approved_date: "2025-10-11"
    approved_by: "jane@acme.com"

# Traceability: specs → tests → implementation
acceptance_criteria:
  - criterion: "All test scenarios pass"
    test_command: "pytest tests/unit/use_cases/test_generate_creatives.py -v"
  - criterion: "Minimum 90% code coverage"
    test_command: "pytest --cov=app.use_cases --cov-report=term"
```

**Benefit:** Clear traceability from stakeholder requirements → tests → implementation
```

#### 2. Add TDD testing strategy to Outputs

**Current:**
> - Technical stack decision log
> - PoC skeleton (repo initialized)
> - Development plan with milestones

**Enhanced:**
> - Technical stack decision log **(if TDD: includes pytest, test fixtures)** ✨
> - PoC skeleton (repo initialized) **(if TDD: includes tests/ directory structure)** ✨
> - Development plan with milestones **(if TDD: includes RED-GREEN-REFACTOR phases)** ✨

---

### Phase 6: Execution & Iteration

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add TDD-specific workflow

**Replace current content with:**

```markdown
### Phase 6: Execution & Iteration

> Build → Measure → Learn → Iterate.

**Goal:** Execute the PoC, learn fast, and adapt.

---

#### TDD Workflow (If Using TDD)

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**

**Week 1: RED + GREEN (With Fakes)**

1. **RED:** Run controller tests
   - Tests fail (no implementation)
   - Understand what needs to be built

2. **GREEN:** Implement controllers
   - Convert requests to domain objects
   - Call use cases (not implemented yet, will mock)
   - Controller tests pass!

3. **RED:** Run use case tests
   - Tests fail (no implementation)

4. **GREEN:** Implement use cases with fake adapters
   - Build business logic
   - Use fakes for all external dependencies:
     - `FakeImageGen` (no OpenAI calls)
     - `FakeVectorStore` (no Weaviate)
     - `FakeStorage` (no S3)
   - Use case tests pass!

5. **CHECKPOINT:** Demo to stakeholders
   - Show working system (using fakes)
   - Cost: $0
   - Get approval: "Yes, this is what we want"

**Week 2: REFACTOR (Real Adapters)**

6. **Parallel Implementation:**
   - Team A: `OpenAIImageGen` (implements `ImageGenPort`)
   - Team B: `WeaviateVectorStore` (implements `VectorStorePort`)
   - Team C: `S3Storage` (implements `StoragePort`)

7. **Integration:**
   - Swap fakes for real adapters in dependency injection
   - Run full test suite
   - Tests still pass! ✅

8. **Final Demo:**
   - Show working system (with real adapters)
   - Stakeholders: "Perfect! Just like we specified"

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

#### Traditional Workflow (If Not Using TDD)

**Activities:**

- Build incrementally following steel thread
- Test manually or with smoke tests
- Capture learnings, blockers, architectural insights
- Iterate or pivot based on feedback

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (includes rework cycles)

---

#### Comparison

| Aspect | TDD Approach | Traditional Approach |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Timeline** | 1-2 weeks | 2-4 weeks |
| **Rework** | Minimal (specs approved upfront) | High (build → feedback → rebuild) |
| **Cost** | Low (develop with fakes) | High (pay for API calls during development) |
| **Stakeholder Confidence** | High (approved tests) | Medium (approved docs, unsure of interpretation) |
| **Parallel Work** | Easy (clear interfaces) | Hard (dependencies block) |
| **Documentation** | Test suite = living docs | Separate docs (may be stale) |

---
```

#### 2. Update Outputs

**Current:**
> - Working PoC
> - Validation report (what worked, what didn't)
> - Recommendations for next iteration or production hardening

**Enhanced:**
> - Working PoC **(if TDD: with comprehensive test suite)** ✨
> - Validation report (what worked, what didn't) **(if TDD: include test coverage metrics)** ✨
> - Recommendations for next iteration or production hardening **(if TDD: test suite becomes regression suite)** ✨

---

### Phase 7: Reflection & Knowledge Capture

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add TDD-specific retrospective questions

**Add new subsection:**

```markdown
#### TDD Retrospective (If Used TDD)

**Test Coverage Analysis:**
- Controller tests: {{count}} scenarios, {{percentage}}% coverage
- Use case tests: {{count}} scenarios, {{percentage}}% coverage
- Integration tests: {{count}} scenarios
- E2E tests: {{count}} happy paths

**Stakeholder Alignment:**
- Rework required? (Yes/No)
  - If yes: Why? What tests didn't catch?
  - If no: Celebrate! 🎉
- Stakeholder workshop duration: {{hours}}
- Time to first demo (with fakes): {{days}}
- Time to final demo (with real adapters): {{days}}

**Time Comparison:**
- Estimated time without TDD: {{weeks}}
- Actual time with TDD: {{weeks}}
- **Time saved:** {{percentage}}%

**Cost Comparison:**
- API costs if tested with real adapters during development: ${{amount}}
- Actual API costs (only final integration): ${{amount}}
- **Cost saved:** {{percentage}}%

**Learnings:**
- What test scenarios did we miss?
- What edge cases surprised us?
- Which fakes were most valuable?
- Would we use TDD again for similar PoC? (Yes/No/Maybe)

**Reusable Artifacts:**
- Fake adapters created (can reuse)
- Entity factories created (can reuse)
- Stakeholder workshop template (refined)
- Test patterns discovered
```

#### 2. Update Outputs

**Current:**
> - Retrospective doc
> - Updated reusable artifacts (schemas, diagrams, templates)
> - Go/no-go decision for productionization

**Enhanced:**
> - Retrospective doc **(if TDD: includes test coverage analysis and time/cost savings)** ✨
> - Updated reusable artifacts **(if TDD: includes fake adapters, entity factories, workshop template)** ✨
> - Go/no-go decision for productionization **(if TDD: test suite ready for production)** ✨

---

### Phase 8: Agentic System Design & Communication

**Changes:**

#### 1. Add automated test running to agent tasks

**Add new agent role:**

```markdown
#### TestAgent (If Using TDD)

**Function:** Run test suite after each generation, report failures

**Triggers:**
- After generation completes
- On-demand via API

**Actions:**
1. Run pytest suite
2. Generate test report
3. If tests fail:
   - Alert humans
   - Create issue with failure details
   - Block deployment
4. If tests pass:
   - Update status dashboard
   - Allow deployment

**Example Agent Task (YAML):**

```yaml
agent: TestAgent
trigger:
  - event: generation_completed
  - event: deployment_requested
actions:
  - name: run_test_suite
    command: "pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=json"
    timeout: 300
  - name: analyze_results
    on_success:
      - update_status: "tests_passing"
      - allow_deployment: true
    on_failure:
      - create_alert:
          type: TEST_FAILURE
          severity: high
          recipients: ["dev-team@acme.com"]
          details: "{test_report}"
      - block_deployment: true
      - create_github_issue:
          title: "Test failures after generation"
          body: "{test_report}"
          labels: ["bug", "tests", "urgent"]
```

**Benefit:** Automated quality gates ensure nothing breaks
```
