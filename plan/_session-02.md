## Claude Instructions - Session 2

### Context
In Session 1, we defined the Lean-Clean Methodology phases. Now we need to create the Framework that implements it.

### Your Task for This Session

**Craft the Framework definitions** (Component B from Primary Components)

Specifically:
1. Review the existing README.lean-clean.md (mostly complete)
2. Define folder architecture for each PoC type:
   - Steel Thread (minimal, spike-level)
   - Pragmatic CA (pragmatic subset for PoCs)
   - Full CA (comprehensive, production-ready)
3. Document how to define executable tests with stakeholders
4. Show how Base Structures can evolve (Steel Thread → Pragmatic → Full)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Folder structure defined for at least Pragmatic CA
- [ ] Clear evolution path between PoC types
- [ ] One complete example test demonstrating Outside-In approach

**We'll tackle the Python code examples in Session 3.**
