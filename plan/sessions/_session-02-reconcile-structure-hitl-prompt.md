# Task: Reconcile STRUCTURE.md with Session 02 Framework Decisions (Session 02 Final Step)

> **Template Version:** 1.0 (2025-10-13)
>
> **Session Context:** This is the **final step of Session 02** - reconciling pre-existing STRUCTURE.md with all 12 resolved architectural decisions. After this reconciliation, finalized documents will move to `/docs/` and `/plan/` can be cleaned up (however, since we still have 03 and 04, a final cleanup wont happen until then, as 03 may need the most important non-duplicated items from 02 files).
>
> **Usage Instructions:** See `/plan/templates/hitl-decision-template.README.md` for when to use this template, how to customize it, and what to do if Claude forgets the process.
>
> **Related Template:** During decision discovery, Claude will create a decisions document using `/plan/templates/decision-document-template.md`.

## Decision-Making Mode: Human-in-the-Loop ⚠️

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** You are operating in **collaborative decision mode**. This means:

1. ❌ **DO NOT make unilateral decisions** about architecture, structure, naming, or patterns
2. ✅ **DO identify all decisions upfront** before starting implementation work
3. ✅ **DO present options with trade-offs** for each decision
4. ✅ **DO wait for my approval** before proceeding with implementation
5. ✅ **DO document each decision** with rationale after I choose

## Your First Task: Decision Discovery

Before writing ANY code or creating ANY documents:

1. **Analyze the task requirements** thoroughly
2. **Identify ALL architectural decisions** that need to be made
3. **Research relevant context** (read any analysis docs, prior decisions, axioms, etc.)
4. **Create a decisions document** listing every choice point you've identified
5. **Present the decisions document to me** for review

For each decision, include:

- **What needs to be decided**
- **Why this decision matters** (impact on the work)
- **Options** (at least 2-3 alternatives)
- **Trade-offs** for each option (pros/cons)
- **Your recommendation** (with reasoning) - BUT make it clear this is a suggestion, not a choice
- **Context** from relevant documents or prior work

## Decision Review Process

After you present the decisions document:

1. **I will review each decision**
2. **I will choose an option** for each (may accept your recommendation or choose differently)
3. **I will provide my rationale** for choices
4. **You will document my decisions** with rationale
5. **Only then** will you proceed with implementation

## During Implementation

If you discover **new decisions** that weren't identified upfront:

1. ❌ **STOP implementation immediately**
2. ✅ **Present the new decision** with options and trade-offs
3. ✅ **Wait for my input** before continuing
4. ✅ **Update the decisions document** with the new choice

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

These are mistakes that waste time and require rework:

❌ **Creating documents/code with implicit choices** - Don't assume, ask first
❌ **"I did X, is this okay?"** - Too late, should have asked before doing X
❌ **Resolving some decisions then discovering more later** - Do thorough analysis upfront
❌ **Making recommendations without showing alternatives** - I need to see the trade-offs
❌ **Proceeding because "this is standard"** - Standards may not fit our context

## Task-Specific Context

### Background

**The Problem:**

`/plan/STRUCTURE.md` was created on 2025-10-11 before Session 02 (2025-10-13). It contains detailed structure recommendations based on three reference implementations (calibration-service, creative-ai-poc, lean-clean-core-skeleton), but now needs reconciliation with Session 02's 12 architectural decisions.

STRUCTURE.md already has a superseded notice referencing Session 01, but it needs comprehensive updating based on Session 02 framework decisions.

**This is Session 02's Final Step:**

After this reconciliation:
1. STRUCTURE.md will be updated or reorganized
2. Finalized framework documents will move to `/docs/`
3. Working documents in `/plan/` can eventually be cleaned up
4. Single source of truth established for folder structures

**Why This Matters:**

- STRUCTURE.md contains valuable analysis from reference implementations
- Session 02 made 12 specific architectural decisions that may conflict
- Future developers will read STRUCTURE.md for guidance
- Need single source of truth for folder structures
- Must preserve valuable reference analysis while updating to match Session 02

### Requirements

**Must accomplish:**

1. **Identify all conflicts** between STRUCTURE.md and Session 02 decisions
2. **Decide for each conflict:** Update STRUCTURE.md, deprecate sections, or preserve with clarification
3. **Maintain valuable content:** Reference implementation analysis, testing patterns, common pitfalls
4. **Ensure consistency:** Terminology, folder names, layer responsibilities
5. **Update or enhance superseded notice:** Point to Session 02 decisions clearly
6. **Plan document finalization:** Which docs move to `/docs/`, which stay in `/plan/`, which get archived

**Key Questions to Answer:**

- Which sections of STRUCTURE.md are still valid?
- Which sections conflict with Session 02 and need updates?
- Which sections should be deprecated/removed?
- How to preserve reference implementation analysis while updating recommendations?
- Should STRUCTURE.md be renamed/reorganized?
- **Which documents are ready to move to `/docs/` after this?**
- **What's the final document structure after Session 02 complete?**

### Constraints

**Must preserve:**
- Reference implementation analysis (calibration-service, creative-ai-poc, lean-clean-core-skeleton)
- Testing strategy patterns
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Technology stack recommendations
- Migration path concepts (even if updating specifics)

**Must respect:**
- All 12 Session 02 architectural decisions
- Established axioms (especially Axiom 3: Fakes are Production Code, Axiom 5: DTO naming)
- Progressive evolution pattern (Steel Thread → Pragmatic CA → Full CA)
- Enterprise PoC Reality (CLI + UI from day 1)

**Must NOT:**
- Lose valuable reference implementation insights
- Create redundancy with `sessions/_session-02-framework-folder-structures.md`
- Introduce new terminology conflicts
- Remove content without considering preservation alternatives

### Success Criteria

**This reconciliation is successful when:**

1. ✅ All conflicts identified and documented
2. ✅ Clear decision made for each conflict (update, deprecate, clarify)
3. ✅ STRUCTURE.md updated to match Session 02 decisions
4. ✅ Reference implementation analysis preserved appropriately
5. ✅ No terminology conflicts between documents
6. ✅ Clear navigation guidance (which doc for what purpose)
7. ✅ Superseded notice updated to reference Session 02
8. ✅ **Plan for document finalization (what moves to `/docs/`)**
9. ✅ **Session 02 can be marked complete and closed**

## Known Conflicts to Investigate

Based on preliminary review, investigate these potential conflicts:

### 1. Terminology
- STRUCTURE.md: "domain/" vs Session 02: "entities/"
- STRUCTURE.md: "controllers" vs Session 02: "orchestrators" (Decision 1)
- Consistency across all folder names

### 2. Folder Structures
- STRUCTURE.md: Recommended baseline structure
- Session 02: Three distinct structures (Steel Thread, Pragmatic CA, Full CA)
- Need to decide: Update STRUCTURE.md or point to Session 02?

### 3. Drivers Layer
- STRUCTURE.md: Drivers mentioned but not emphasized
- Session 02 Decision 9: CLI + UI always, FastAPI when needed (Enterprise PoC Reality)
- Major pattern shift needs reflection

### 4. Infrastructure Split
- STRUCTURE.md: Single infrastructure layer
- Session 02 Decision 10: Split adapters/ + infrastructure/
- Two types of fakes (Decision 8)

### 5. Ports Location
- STRUCTURE.md: Ports in application/ports/
- Session 02 Decision 12: Co-located → extracted (two-step evolution)
- Progressive pattern needs documentation

### 6. DTOs
- STRUCTURE.md: DTOs in application layer
- Session 02 Decision 11: Minimal DTOs with progressive evolution
- Location varies by PoC type

### 7. Interface Adapters Layer
- STRUCTURE.md: Optional interface_adapters layer
- Session 02: interface_adapters/orchestrators (not controllers)
- Naming and prominence differs

### 8. Test Structure
- STRUCTURE.md: unit/integration/e2e
- Session 02 Decision 7: acceptance/unit/integration (Outside-In TDD emphasis)
- Terminology and philosophy alignment needed

---

## Reconciliation Strategy Options

Consider these approaches (will need decisions for each section):

### Option A: Update STRUCTURE.md In-Place
- Keep filename and overall structure
- Update conflicting sections to match Session 02
- Add cross-references to Session 02 docs
- Enhanced superseded notice

### Option B: Deprecate and Redirect
- Add comprehensive "SUPERSEDED BY SESSION 02" notice at top
- Preserve entire document as historical reference
- Point readers to Session 02 framework doc
- Rename to `STRUCTURE-DEPRECATED.md`?

### Option C: Reorganize and Split
- Extract reference implementation analysis to separate doc
- Update recommendations to match Session 02
- Create clear document boundaries (what STRUCTURE.md covers vs framework doc)
- Possible rename: `REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`?

### Option D: Hybrid Approach
- Preserve reference implementation analysis
- Update "Recommended PoC Structure" section to point to Session 02
- Update terminology throughout
- Keep valuable content (pitfalls, tech stack, testing)
- Enhanced navigation section

---

## Expected Decisions

Here are some decisions you'll likely need to present (identify ALL during discovery):

1. **Overall approach:** Update in-place vs deprecate vs reorganize vs hybrid?
2. **Terminology updates:** Which terms need global replacement (domain→entities, controller→orchestrator)?
3. **Folder structure section:** Update vs redirect vs remove?
4. **Reference implementation analysis:** Preserve as-is vs update vs extract?
5. **Layer responsibilities:** Update to match Session 02 vs keep as alternate perspective?
6. **Testing strategy:** Update terminology to match Session 02's acceptance/unit/integration?
7. **Migration path:** Update to match Session 02's progressive evolution pattern?
8. **Technology stack:** Keep as-is (still valid) vs update?
9. **Common pitfalls:** Keep as-is (still valid) vs update?
10. **Superseded notice:** How to update for Session 02 reference?
11. **Document navigation:** How to guide readers between STRUCTURE.md and framework docs?
12. **File naming:** Keep STRUCTURE.md vs rename?
13. **Document finalization:** Which Session 02 docs move to `/docs/`? Which stay in `/plan/`?
14. **What gets archived:** Which `/plan/` docs can be removed after finalization?

These are just examples - you may discover more during analysis.

## Document Finalization Plan (Part of This Task)

After reconciliation, we need to decide:

### Candidates for `/docs/` (Finalized)
- Updated STRUCTURE.md (or renamed version)
- `sessions/_session-02-framework-folder-structures.md` (rename without underscore?)
- Anything else ready for "finalized" status?

### Keep in `/plan/` (Working Documents)
- Session-specific decision documents (`sessions/_session-02-decisions-needed.md`, etc.)
- Context preservation files (`sessions/_session-02-all-decisions-resolved.md`)
- Summaries (`sessions/_session-02-summary*.md`)
- Or should some move to `/docs/` as permanent record?

### Archive or Remove
- Superseded documents
- Duplicate content
- Context files once information migrated

**This needs explicit decisions during reconciliation.**

---

## Delivery Format

After all decisions resolved, produce:

1. **Updated STRUCTURE.md** (or renamed file based on decisions)
2. **Finalized framework document** (if moving to `/docs/`)
3. **Document finalization plan** (what moves where, what gets archived)
4. **Change log** in commit message (what was updated, deprecated, preserved)
5. **Navigation guidance** (comment in files or separate doc explaining document relationships)
6. **Session 02 closure commit** marking session complete

---

## Ready?

Please begin with **Decision Discovery**:

1. Read all "Must Read" documents thoroughly
2. Compare STRUCTURE.md with Session 02 decisions systematically
3. Identify ALL conflicts, ambiguities, and decision points
4. Create a comprehensive decisions document
5. **Include decisions about document finalization** (what moves to `/docs/`)
6. Present it to me before making any changes

Remember: The goal is collaborative decision-making, not autonomous implementation.

**This is Session 02's final step.** Let's close it properly with:
- STRUCTURE.md reconciled
- Documents finalized and moved to appropriate locations
- Clear foundation for Session 03 (Code Paradigms or Test Patterns)

Let's ensure STRUCTURE.md becomes a valuable complement to Session 02 framework decisions, not a source of confusion.
