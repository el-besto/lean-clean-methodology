# Session 02 Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Document Evolution:**
- **Current:** This document (initial high-level summary created early in session)
- **Next:** `sessions/_session-02-summary-framework-folder-structures.md` (detailed summary with all 12 decisions)
- **Reconciliation Needed:** `/plan/STRUCTURE.md` (pre-existing structure document)

---

## Session Goal

Define the Framework (Component B) by creating concrete folder structures for all three PoC types with evolution paths and complete feature examples.

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Created Comprehensive Framework Document

Created `/plan/_session-02-framework-folder-structures.md` with:

- **Pragmatic CA structure** (the sweet spot for enterprise PoCs)
  - Detailed folder layout with 5 Clean Architecture layers
  - Maps to nikolovlazar's modern CA pattern
  - Explicit Infrastructure layer separate from Frameworks & Drivers
  - Test structure mirrors app structure (acceptance, unit, integration)

- **Complete feature example: Localized Campaign Generation**
  - Acceptance test showing Outside-In TDD with stakeholders
  - Controller implementation (orchestration layer)
  - Use case implementation (business logic)
  - Interface definition (infrastructure contracts)
  - Fake adapter (test double for workshops)
  - Full Outside-In workflow walkthrough

- **Steel Thread structure** (minimal for spikes)
  - Simplified 1-2 layer structure
  - Flat use_cases/, adapters/, single test file
  - When to use vs. Pragmatic CA

- **Full CA structure** (production-grade)
  - Comprehensive layering with rich aggregates
  - Separate entities from ORM models (repository pattern)
  - Domain events, event sourcing, CQRS
  - When to evolve from Pragmatic CA

- **Evolution path documentation**
  - Migration checklists: Steel Thread → Pragmatic CA → Full CA
  - Decision matrix for when to evolve
  - Key insight: Progressive refinement, not rewrites

---

### 2. ✅ Key Design Principles Documented

**Self-Evident Architecture:**
- Folder structure reveals layer boundaries
- One-to-one mapping: Feature test → Controller
- Test structure mirrors app structure

**Progressive Refinement:**
- Steel Thread → Pragmatic CA adds layers (controllers, presenters, interfaces)
- Pragmatic CA → Full CA refines implementation (entities, events, DTOs)
- Same test philosophy across all types (Outside-In with fakes)

**Outside-In TDD:**
- Write acceptance tests with stakeholders first
- Implement with fakes (fast feedback, no API keys)
- Add real adapters in parallel (tests still pass)

---

### 3. ✅ Pragmatic CA: The Sweet Spot

Identified **Pragmatic CA** as the recommended starting point for enterprise PoCs:

**Why Pragmatic CA?**
- ✅ Fast enough (3-5 days vs. weeks for Full CA)
- ✅ Production-ready subset (controllers + presenters)
- ✅ Multi-use-case orchestration (controllers coordinate use cases)
- ✅ Testable cross-cutting concerns (presenters handle telemetry/events)
- ✅ Clear evolution path to Full CA when needed

**When NOT Pragmatic CA?**
- Steel Thread: 1-2 day feasibility spike (drop layers)
- Full CA: Production scaling, complex domain (add layers)

---

## Success Criteria Validation

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Folder structure defined for at least Pragmatic CA | ✅ Complete | Section 1 of Framework doc |
| Clear evolution path between PoC types | ✅ Complete | Section 5 with migration checklists |
| One complete example test demonstrating Outside-In | ✅ Complete | Section 2 (Localized Campaign) |

---

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

✅ **Didn't create overly abstract structures** - Max 3-4 levels, clear responsibilities
✅ **Didn't copy folder structures blindly** - Adapted CA to PoC constraints, documented trade-offs
✅ **Didn't write documentation without examples** - Complete feature example with 6 files
✅ **Didn't ignore test organization** - Test structure mirrors app structure
✅ **Didn't treat all PoC types the same** - Steel Thread dramatically simpler than Full CA

## Key Insights

### 1. nikolovlazar's Pattern is the Right Foundation

The **explicit Infrastructure layer** (separate from Frameworks & Drivers) solves the "where do adapters go?" question:

- `core/interfaces/` defines contracts (application needs)
- `adapters/` implements contracts (infrastructure capabilities)
- `server.py`, `cli.py` are Frameworks & Drivers (entry points)

This is clearer than Bob Martin's classic diagram which conflates Infrastructure with Frameworks.

### 2. Fakes are Production Code, Not Test Code

`FakeImageGenerator` lives in `adapters/`, not `tests/`, because:
- It's a first-class implementation of the interface
- Used in acceptance tests, workshops, local dev, CI/CD
- Enables Outside-In TDD: write tests before real adapters exist

This is a key enabler of the "Outside-In with stakeholders" workflow.

### 3. Feature = Controller Pattern Prevents Confusion

Test language uses "Feature" (stakeholder term from BDD):
- `tests/acceptance/features/test_localized_campaign_feature.py`

Implementation language uses "Controller" (CA term):
- `app/interface_adapters/controllers/campaign_controller.py`

One-to-one mapping makes codebase navigable. Avoids bikeshedding over "Orchestrator" vs "Service" vs "Facade."

### 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns Placement Depends on PoC Type

**Pragmatic CA:** Explicit presenter methods (`attach_telemetry()`, `emit_events()`)
- ✅ Pragmatic, testable, stakeholder-visible
- ❌ Some duplication across presenters

**Full CA:** Middleware/decorators (`@trace`, `@retry`, `@cache`)
- ✅ DRY, AOP separation
- ❌ More complex, harder to debug

Match the solution to the PoC type's goals (speed vs. maintainability).

### 5. The Evolution Path is the Secret Weapon

All three PoC types use the **same testing philosophy**:
- Outside-In with stakeholders
- Acceptance tests with fakes
- Use cases depend on interfaces

This means **tests don't break when you evolve**:
- Steel Thread → Pragmatic CA: Add layers, tests still pass
- Pragmatic CA → Full CA: Refine implementation, tests still pass

**Stakeholder contract is stable.** You're evolving the inside, not changing the outside.

## What Changed

**Files Created:**
1. `/plan/_session-02-framework-folder-structures.md` - Complete Framework definition (65KB)
2. `/plan/_session-02-summary.md` - This summary

**Files NOT Changed:**
- `README.md` - Kept as-is, references Session 02 via CLAUDE.md

## Example Highlights

### Complete Feature Example: Localized Campaign Generation

Demonstrates the full Outside-In workflow:

1. **Acceptance Test** (`test_localized_campaign_feature.py`)
   - Readable by stakeholders (Creative Lead, Ad Ops, IT, Legal)
   - Uses fakes (no API calls, <1s execution)
   - BDD docstrings (Given/When/Then)
   - Validates all stakeholder requirements

2. **Controller** (`campaign_controller.py`)
   - Orchestrates 3 use cases: generate → validate → emit events
   - Thin coordination logic
   - Fail-fast validation

3. **Use Case** (`generate_campaign.py`)
   - Pure business logic
   - Depends on interfaces (`IImageGenerator`, `IStorageAdapter`)
   - Enforces business rules (budget cap, A/B variants)

4. **Interface** (`image_generator.py`)
   - Protocol defining application needs
   - Includes business concerns (`cost_per_image`)

5. **Fake Adapter** (`fake_imagegen.py`)
   - Production code in `adapters/`, not `tests/`
   - Realistic behavior (latency, costs, deterministic outputs)
   - Enables workshops without API keys

6. **Outside-In Workflow**
   - Day 1: Write test with stakeholders → RED
   - Day 2: Implement with fakes → GREEN
   - Day 3+: Add real adapters → GREEN (contract unchanged)

---

## Next Session

**Session 03** will tackle Component D (Code Paradigms):
- Python code examples for each pattern
- DI setup patterns
- Testing patterns (fixtures, fakes, mocks)
- Error handling patterns
- Cross-cutting concerns implementation

The Framework document provides the structure; Session 03 will provide the concrete code.

## Quote

> "The folder structure should make the architecture self-evident. A developer should be able to clone the repo and immediately understand where to add new features."

Session 02 achieved this by:
- Mapping folders to CA layers explicitly
- One-to-one Feature → Controller mapping
- Test structure mirroring app structure
- Complete working example showing the flow
