# Session 02: Framework Folder Structures - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ✅ ALL 12 ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS RESOLVED
**Branch:** draft
**Mode:** Human-in-the-Loop Collaborative Decision-Making

---

## Session 02 Achievements

### ✅ Primary Goal: Define Framework Folder Structures
**Completed:** Framework folder structures fully defined for all three PoC types:
- **Steel Thread** (1-2 days)
- **Pragmatic CA** (3-5 days)
- **Full CA** (Production)

### ✅ All 12 Architectural Decisions Resolved

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | Terminology | ✅ "Orchestrator" (not "Controller") |
| 2 | Folder depth | ✅ Progressive (flat → moderate → deep) |
| 3 | Document scope | ✅ Comprehensive (all 3 PoC types) |
| 4 | Example scenario | ✅ Localized Campaign Generation |
| 5 | Code detail | ✅ Detailed but incomplete |
| 6 | Interface style | ✅ Protocol (not ABC) |
| 7 | Test structure | ✅ acceptance/unit/integration |
| 8 | Fakes location | ✅ adapters/ + infrastructure/repositories/ |
| 9 | Drivers layer | ✅ CLI + UI always, FastAPI when needed |
| 10 | Adapters/Infrastructure | ✅ Split with two-step port evolution |
| 11 | DTO strategy | ✅ Minimal with progressive evolution |
| 12 | Ports location | ✅ Co-located → extracted (from Decision 10) |

## Key Architectural Patterns Established

### 1. Two-Step Evolution Pattern
**Applied to:** Ports, DTOs, Folder Organization

**Pattern:**
1. **Co-locate/Simplify** (Steel Thread/Pragmatic CA) - Keep related code together
2. **Extract/Formalize** (Full CA) - Separate concerns when complexity justifies

**Examples:**
- **Ports:** Co-located `protocol.py` → Extracted to `application/ports/`
- **DTOs:** None → Driver boundaries (`drivers/rest/schemas/`) → Use case boundaries
- **Drivers:** Flat → Organized subfolders → Production-ready with middleware

### 2. Enterprise PoC Reality (Critical Discovery)
**From Decision 9 analysis:**

Traditional PoCs: "just a CLI"
Enterprise PoCs: **CLI + UI from day 1**

**Why:** Multi-stakeholder workshops require:
- ✅ **CLI** - Automation, reproducibility, CI/CD
- ✅ **Streamlit UI** - Visual feedback (Creative Lead, Legal, Ad Ops, IT)
- ⚠️ **FastAPI** - Only when integrating with enterprise systems

**Impact:** Even Steel Thread needs `drivers/` folder with CLI + UI

### 3. Fakes Have Two Forms (Stakeholder Audiences)
**From Decision 8:**

1. **Fake Adapters** → `app/adapters/`
   - External services (OpenAI, DAM, CRM)
   - **Audience:** Business stakeholders

2. **In-Memory Repositories** → `app/infrastructure/repositories/`
   - Persistence (Postgres, MongoDB)
   - **Audience:** DevOps/IT stakeholders

**Why separate:** Different mental models, different stakeholder concerns

## Key Insights for Implementation

### Insight 1: Progressive = Additive (Not Transformative)
**Good evolution:**
```
Steel Thread:    app/adapters/fake_imagegen.py
Pragmatic CA:    app/adapters/imagegen/fake.py      # Added nesting
Full CA:         app/adapters/imagegen/fake.py      # Same location
```

**Bad evolution (avoided):**
```
Steel Thread:    tests/fakes/fake_imagegen.py       # Wrong layer
Pragmatic CA:    app/adapters/imagegen/fake.py      # REWORK: moved layers
Full CA:         app/infrastructure/external/...    # REWORK: moved again
```

### Insight 2: Terminology Consistency Enables Evolution
**Consistent across all PoC types:**
- "Orchestrator" (not Controller)
- Fakes in production code (not tests/)
- Protocol-based interfaces (not ABC)
- Three-layer testing (acceptance/unit/integration)

### Insight 3: Stakeholder Visibility First
**Framework optimized for:**
- Workshop demos with visual feedback
- Non-technical stakeholders reading tests
- Business domain language (not technical jargon)
- Outside-In TDD workflow

### Insight 4: Pragmatic vs. Dogmatic
**We deviate from pure Clean Architecture:**
- ✅ Pragmatic CA: Entities can be ORM models (acceptable for PoCs)
- ✅ Steel Thread: No DTOs (domain objects cross boundaries)
- ✅ Streamlit for UI (not React/Vue complexity)
- ❌ Never: Violate dependency inversion

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase)

### 1. Update Framework Document ⏳
**File:** `sessions/_session-02-framework-folder-structures.md`

**Updates needed:**
- Incorporate all 12 resolved decisions
- Update Steel Thread section with drivers/ folder
- Update Pragmatic CA with co-located ports + minimal DTOs
- Update Full CA with extracted ports + use case DTOs
- Add migration paths (already scripted in `sessions/_session-02-all-decisions-resolved.md`)
- Ensure code examples match resolved patterns

**Reference:** Use `sessions/_session-02-all-decisions-resolved.md` as source of truth

### 2. Verify Consistency ⏳
- [x] Axioms document (already updated)
- [x] Blog post (already updated)
- [x] Decision documents (complete)
- [ ] Framework document (needs update)
- [ ] Code examples match patterns

### 3. Create Final Session Summary ⏳
**File:** `sessions/_session-02-summary.md`

**Contents:**

- Next session prep

### 4. Commit Session 02 Work ⏳
**Branch:** draft → main

**Commit message:**
```

All 12 architectural decisions resolved:
- Progressive evolution pattern (flat → moderate → deep)
- Two-step transformation (co-locate → extract)
- Enterprise PoC reality (CLI + UI from day 1)
- Fakes in two locations (adapters/ + infrastructure/)

Framework now fully defined for Steel Thread, Pragmatic CA, Full CA.

Closes Session 02.
```

## Session Metrics

**Duration:** 1 session (multiple conversation continuations)
**Decisions Made:** 12 (collaborative HITL process)
**Documents Created:** 3 major context files
**Documents Updated:** 5 (axioms, blog, understanding, decisions)
**Lines of Documentation:** 1,500+ lines of architectural decisions
**Key Pattern Discoveries:** 3 (two-step evolution, enterprise reality, stakeholder fakes)

---

## Lessons Learned (Meta)

### What Worked Well:
1. **HITL Methodology:** Presenting options with trade-offs → user decides → document rationale
2. **Context Preservation:** Creating resolution files before context limits
3. **Progressive Decision-Making:** Resolving dependencies (Decision 10 → Decision 12)
4. **Stakeholder Focus:** Keeping enterprise workshop reality front and center

### Process Improvements for Next Session:
1. **Start with decision discovery:** Identify all decisions upfront before implementation
2. **Create resolution files proactively:** Don't wait for context limits
3. **Keep consistent terminology:** Track terms across all documents
4. **Reference prior decisions:** Decisions build on each other (10 → 12, 9 → 11)
