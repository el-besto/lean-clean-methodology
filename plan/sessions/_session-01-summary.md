# Session 01 Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Session Goal

Refine and define the Lean-Clean Methodology (Component A) by resolving divergent architectural questions and clarifying methodology phases.

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Answered Divergent Architectural Questions

Created `/plan/_session-01-architectural-decisions.md` with detailed answers:

- **Q1: How much CA?** → Three PoC types: Steel Thread (1-2 days), Pragmatic CA (3-5 days), Full CA (production)
- **Q2: Cross-cutting concerns?** → Presenters for Pragmatic CA, Middleware for Full CA
- **Q3: pytest vs Gherkin?** → pytest with BDD docstrings (readability without ceremony)
- **Q4: "Feature" concept?** → Yes, maps to Controllers (orchestration layer)
- **Q5: Evolution path?** → Progressive refinement with same test philosophy

Each answer includes rationale, trade-offs, and code examples.

---

### 2. ✅ Refined Methodology Phases

Made **minimal clarifying edits** to `README.md`:

**Changes:**
1. **Framework Structure (line 35):** Added note about three PoC types with reference to Session 01 decisions
2. **Phase 5 Activities (line 174):** Added PoC type selection as first activity
3. **Phase 5 Outputs (line 182):** Added PoC type decision with rationale
4. **Phase 7 Activities (line 217):** Added evolution path decision
5. **Phase 7 Outputs (line 223):** Added evolution decision output

**Rationale for changes:**
- Phase 5 violated Q1 (unspecified CA variant)
- Phase 7 violated Q5 (missing evolution decision)
- Framework structure lacked context (which PoC type shown)

**Phases NOT changed:** P0-P4, P6, P8 were already well-defined and didn't violate architectural decisions.

---

### 3. ✅ Laid Foundation for Session 02

Architectural decisions document explicitly calls out Session 02 work:
- Define concrete folder structures for each PoC type
- Create Python code examples (social media campaign scenario)
- Document "Lean-Clean Code Paradigms" (Component D)
- Framework definition (Component B)

---

## Success Criteria Validation

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Divergent questions answered with rationale | ✅ Complete | `sessions/_session-01-architectural-decisions.md` |
| Methodology phases defined and documented | ✅ Complete | `README.md` (refined) |
| Foundation for Framework definition | ✅ Complete | Session 02 scope defined |

---

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

✅ **Didn't jump to implementation** - Focused on conceptual design (PoC types, evolution paths)
✅ **Didn't treat sketch projects as gospel** - Extracted patterns, challenged via CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md
✅ **Didn't over-architect** - Three PoC types balance speed vs. rigor
✅ **Didn't create unnecessary terminology** - Reused CA/DDD/BDD terms (Controller, Feature, Protocol)
✅ **Didn't define phases in vacuum** - Kept multi-stakeholder enterprise context throughout

## Key Insights

### 1. Terminology Clarity Matters
"Steel thread" has two meanings:
- **Lean sense:** Minimal viable slice (scope decision) - used in Phase 3
- **PoC type sense:** Minimal CA implementation (architecture decision) - used in Phase 5

Keeping them distinct prevents confusion.

### 2. Evolution > Revolution
All three PoC types use the **same testing philosophy** (Outside-In with fakes). Stakeholder tests written in Steel Thread still pass in Full CA. You're refining implementation, not changing contracts.

### 3. Pragmatic CA is the Sweet Spot
For enterprise PoCs with multi-stakeholder workshops:
- Steel Thread lacks orchestration (can't coordinate multiple use cases)
- Full CA is over-engineering (80% of PoCs die after validation)
- Pragmatic CA balances speed and production-readiness

### 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns Belong in Presenters (for PoCs)
Telemetry, events, and metrics are "output for observability systems" - conceptually aligned with presenters formatting output for APIs/UIs. Middleware/decorators are cleaner for Full CA, but presenters win for velocity.

## What Changed in README.md

**Additions (bolded in diff):**
- Framework Structure note about three PoC types
- Phase 5: "Select PoC type" as first activity
- Phase 5: "PoC type decision" as output
- Phase 7: "Decide evolution path" as activity
- Phase 7: "Evolution decision" as output

**Philosophy preserved:**
- 8-phase structure (P0-P8) unchanged
- Core principles unchanged
- Agentic design (Phase 8) unchanged
- Testing/observability guidance unchanged

---

## Files Created

1. `/plan/_session-01-architectural-decisions.md` - Divergent questions answers with rationale
2. `/plan/_session-01-summary.md` - This summary

---

## Next Session

**Session 02** will tackle Component B (Framework) and Component D (Code Paradigms):
- Folder structures for Steel Thread, Pragmatic CA, Full CA
- Python examples using multi-agent social media campaign scenario
- Testing patterns (acceptance, unit, integration, e2e)
- Cross-cutting concerns implementation (presenters, middleware)

## Quote

> "The goal: Accelerate enterprise PoCs by defining executable tests early with stakeholders. The methodology must support this goal at every phase, balancing rigor with speed."

Session 01 resolved how to balance rigor with speed: **three PoC types with clear evolution paths.**
