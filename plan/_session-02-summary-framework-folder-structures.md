# Session 02: Framework Folder Structures - Detailed Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Branch:** draft
**Methodology:** Human-in-the-Loop Collaborative Decision-Making

**Document Evolution:**
- **Previous:** `_session-02-summary.md` (initial high-level summary)
- **Current:** This document (detailed framework-specific summary with all 12 decisions)
- **Next Session:** Reconcile with `/plan/STRUCTURE.md` (pre-existing structure document)

---

## Executive Summary

Session 02 successfully resolved all 12 architectural decisions needed to define complete framework folder structures for the Lean-Clean Methodology. The framework now provides concrete, copy-paste ready folder structures for three PoC types: Steel Thread (1-2 days), Pragmatic CA (3-5 days), and Full CA (production).

**Key Achievement:** Established progressive evolution patterns that enable additive refinement without rewrites across all three PoC types.

---

## Session Goals (Achieved)

### Primary Goal: Define Framework Folder Structures ✅
**Deliverable:** Complete folder structures for all three PoC types

**What We Delivered:**
- Steel Thread structure with drivers/ from day 1
- Pragmatic CA structure with adapters/infrastructure split
- Full CA structure with extracted ports and comprehensive DTOs
- Migration paths with executable bash commands
- Complete code examples for Localized Campaign Generation feature

---

## All 12 Architectural Decisions Resolved

| # | Decision | Resolution | Impact |
|---|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Terminology | **"Orchestrator"** (not "Controller") | Stakeholder clarity |
| 2 | Folder depth | **Progressive** (flat → moderate → deep) | Scales with complexity |
| 3 | Document scope | **Comprehensive** (all 3 PoC types) | Shows evolution path |
| 4 | Example scenario | **Localized Campaign Generation** | Multi-stakeholder realism |
| 5 | Code detail | **Detailed but incomplete** | Clarity without verbosity |
| 6 | Interface style | **Protocol** (not ABC) | Pythonic, no inheritance |
| 7 | Test structure | **acceptance/unit/integration** | Matches Outside-In TDD |
| 8 | Fakes location | **Two types:** `adapters/` + `infrastructure/repositories/` | Different stakeholder audiences |
| 9 | Drivers layer | **Progressive:** CLI+UI always, FastAPI when needed | Enterprise PoC reality |
| 10 | Gateways split | **Split:** `adapters/` + `infrastructure/` | Business vs IT mental models |
| 11 | DTO strategy | **Minimal with progressive evolution** | Speed over formality |
| 12 | Ports location | **Co-located → extracted** | Two-step evolution |

## Key Architectural Patterns Discovered

### Pattern 1: Two-Step Evolution
**Applied to:** Ports, DTOs, Folder Organization

1. **Co-locate/Simplify** (Steel Thread/Pragmatic CA) - Keep related code together for speed
2. **Extract/Formalize** (Full CA) - Separate concerns when complexity justifies

**Examples:**
- **Ports:** `protocol.py` co-located → Extracted to `application/ports/`
- **DTOs:** None → Driver boundaries → Use case boundaries
- **Drivers:** Flat → Organized subfolders → Production middleware

**Why It Matters:** Enables evolution without rewrites. Imports extend (add depth), don't transform (change root).

---

### Pattern 2: Enterprise PoC Reality (Critical Discovery)

**Traditional PoCs:** "just a CLI"
**Enterprise PoCs:** **CLI + UI from day 1**

**Why:** Multi-stakeholder workshops require:
- ✅ **CLI** (ALWAYS) - Automation, reproducibility, CI/CD
- ✅ **Streamlit UI** (ALWAYS) - Visual feedback for Creative Lead, Legal, Ad Ops, IT
- ⚠️ **FastAPI** (WHEN NEEDED) - Enterprise integrations, webhooks

**Impact:** Even Steel Thread needs `drivers/` folder. This isn't over-engineering—it's recognizing that enterprise AI PoCs involve stakeholders who need to SEE the output, not just read logs.

---

### Pattern 3: Fakes Have Two Forms (Stakeholder Audiences)

1. **Fake Adapters** → `app/adapters/`
   - External services (OpenAI, DAM, CRM)
   - **Audience:** Business stakeholders (Creative Lead, Ad Ops, Legal)

2. **In-Memory Repositories** → `app/infrastructure/repositories/`
   - Persistence (Postgres, MongoDB)
   - **Audience:** DevOps/IT stakeholders

**Why Separate:** Different mental models, different stakeholder concerns. Business stakeholders think "external services," IT thinks "databases and persistence."

---

### Pattern 4: Progressive = Additive (Not Transformative)

**Good evolution:**
```
Steel Thread:    app/adapters/fake_imagegen.py
Pragmatic CA:    app/adapters/imagegen/fake.py      # Added nesting
Full CA:         app/adapters/imagegen/fake.py      # Same location
```

**Bad evolution (avoided):**
```
Steel Thread:    tests/fakes/fake_imagegen.py       # Wrong layer
Pragmatic CA:    app/adapters/imagegen/fake.py      # REWORK: moved layers
Full CA:         app/infrastructure/external/...    # REWORK: moved again
```

- ✅ Test structures consistently show acceptance/unit/integration layers

---

## Lessons Learned (Meta - Process Improvements)

### What Worked Well
1. **HITL Methodology:** Presenting options with trade-offs → user decides → document rationale
2. **Context Preservation:** Creating resolution files proactively before context limits (89%, 92%, 94%)
3. **Progressive Decision-Making:** Resolving dependencies in order (Decision 10 before 12)
4. **Stakeholder Focus:** Keeping enterprise workshop reality front and center
5. **Two-Step Pattern Recognition:** Identified common evolution pattern across multiple decisions

### Process Improvements for Next Session
1. **Start with decision discovery:** Identify all decisions upfront before implementation
2. **Create resolution files proactively:** Don't wait for context limits
3. **Keep consistent terminology:** Track terms across all documents (e.g., "Orchestrator")
4. **Reference prior decisions:** Decisions build on each other (10 → 12, 9 → 11)
5. **Verify cross-references:** Ensure blog/axioms/framework all aligned

## Migration Paths Defined

### Steel Thread → Pragmatic CA
**When:** Stakeholders approved, need production path

**Key Changes:**
1. Add `infrastructure/repositories/` layer (Decision 10)
2. Add `interface_adapters/orchestrators/` (Decision 1)
3. Organize drivers into `drivers/{cli,rest,ui}/` (Decision 9)
4. Add API DTOs at `drivers/rest/schemas/` (Decision 11)
5. Add presenters for telemetry and formatting

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

---

### Pragmatic CA → Full CA
**When:** Scaling to multi-team, production load, complex domain

**Key Changes:**
1. Extract ports: `protocol.py` → `application/ports/` (Decision 12)
2. Add use case DTOs: `use_cases/*/dtos.py` (Decision 11)
3. Organize under `application/` folder (Decision 2)
4. Separate entities from ORM (domain purity)
5. Add production middleware to drivers (Decision 9)
6. Add Kubernetes, Alembic, E2E tests

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 weeks

**Bash scripts provided in:** `_session-02-all-decisions-resolved.md`

## Next Session Prep (Session 03)

### Critical Task: Reconcile with Pre-Existing STRUCTURE.md
**File:** `/plan/STRUCTURE.md` (pre-existing structure document)

**Reconciliation Needed:**
- Compare Session 02 decisions with pre-existing STRUCTURE.md
- Identify conflicts or outdated patterns in STRUCTURE.md
- Update or deprecate STRUCTURE.md based on Session 02 outcomes
- Ensure consistent folder structures across all documentation

### Session 03 Candidates

**Option A: Code Paradigms (Component C)**
- Implement complete Steel Thread example
- Show Outside-In TDD workflow
- Document testing patterns with fixtures

**Option B: Test Patterns Deep Dive**
- Acceptance test patterns with fakes
- Integration test patterns with real adapters
- Fixture organization and DI for tests

**Option C: DI Container Evolution**
- Manual DI (Steel Thread)
- Dependencies module (Pragmatic CA)
- DI container (Full CA)

**Option D: Streamlit UI Patterns**
- Multi-stakeholder page patterns
- Creative Lead workflow
- Legal approval workflow
- Component reuse patterns

**Recommendation:** Start with **reconciling STRUCTURE.md**, then proceed with **Option A (Code Paradigms)** to validate framework decisions with working code.

## Document Evolution Notes

**Why Two Summaries?**

- This document - Created at session end, comprehensive with all 12 decisions integrated
- Both preserved to show evolution of thinking during Session 02

**For Next Session Agent:**
Read both summaries to understand the progression:
1. Initial summary captured early insights (Feature = Controller pattern, nikolovlazar foundation)
2. Final summary captures complete architectural decisions and patterns
3. Reconcile both with `/plan/STRUCTURE.md` to ensure consistency
