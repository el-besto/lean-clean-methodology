## 1. Clean Architecture Diagrams (`/ca/`)

### 1.1 Bob Martin's Clean Architecture (classic)
**File**: `clean-architecture-diagram-martin.jpg`

**Description**: The canonical Clean Architecture diagram by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), featuring concentric circles representing architectural layers with strict dependency rules.

**Key Elements**:
- **Center (Yellow)**: Entities - Enterprise Business Rules
- **Second Ring (Pink/Red)**: Use Cases - Application Business Rules
- **Third Ring (Green)**: Interface Adapters - Controllers, Gateways, Presenters
- **Outer Ring (Blue)**: Frameworks & Drivers - Devices, Web, UI, DB, External Interfaces

**Notable Features**:
- Concentric circle design emphasizing the dependency rule (dependencies point inward)
- Explicit flow of control diagram showing Presenter → Use Case Interactor → Controller with Input/Output Ports
- Color-coded layers for quick visual identification
- Abstract and conceptual, focusing on principles over implementation
- Demonstrates ports and adapters pattern explicitly

**Use Case**: Best for explaining fundamental Clean Architecture principles and the dependency inversion rule.

### 1.2 nikolovlazar's Clean Architecture (modern/implementation)
**File**: `clean-architecture-diagram-nikolovlazar.jpg`

**Description**: A modern, vertically-layered interpretation of Clean Architecture with concrete implementation details and explicit infrastructure separation.

**Key Elements** (bottom to top):
1. **Entities (Yellow/Tan)**: Models (Link, Collection, Relation, User), Errors, etc.
2. **Application (Pink)**: Use Cases (CreateLink, SignIn, AddLinkToCollection) and Infrastructure Interfaces
3. **Interface Adapters (Green)**: Controllers, Presenters
4. **Top Layer (Blue)** - Split into two:
   - **Frameworks & Drivers**: API, server components, server actions, AWS Lambda
   - **Infrastructure**: Repositories, shared services (auth, email), etc.

**Notable Features**:
- Vertical layered architecture with clear separation
- Dependency arrows flowing downward (toward core)
- External services (Ext.Service, Database) shown at top with dependency arrows
- Includes concrete technology examples (AWS Lambda, repositories, auth services)
- Explicitly shows "Infrastructure Interfaces" within Application layer
- Annotation: "*achieved through DI" (Dependency Injection)
- Annotation: "*transitively" on sides indicating transitive dependencies
- Framework icons shown (appears to be AWS Lambda, Next.js, and Svelte logos)

**Use Case**: Best for practical implementation guidance and understanding how to structure a real codebase.

## 2. Comparative Analysis: Martin vs. nikolovlazar Clean Architecture

### Visual Representation Philosophy

| Aspect | Bob Martin (Classic) | nikolovlazar (Modern) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Layout** | Concentric circles | Vertical layers/stacks |
| **Metaphor** | Onion/rings | Architectural tiers |
| **Orientation** | Radial (center-out) | Bottom-up hierarchy |
| **Flow** | Circular with explicit ports | Linear dependency flow |

### Abstraction Level

**Bob Martin**:
- Highly abstract and conceptual
- Generic terms (Entities, Use Cases, Controllers)
- No technology-specific references
- Focuses on principles and patterns
- Timeless and framework-agnostic

**nikolovlazar**:
- Concrete and implementation-focused
- Specific examples (CreateLink, SignIn, AWS Lambda)
- Technology stack visible
- Shows real-world code organization
- Tied to modern web/serverless patterns

### Key Architectural Differences

#### 1. Infrastructure Layer Treatment

**Martin's Approach**:
- Infrastructure is part of "Frameworks & Drivers" outer ring
- Not explicitly separated from framework code
- Combined with UI, Web, Devices, and DB

**nikolovlazar's Extension**:
- **Explicit Infrastructure Layer**: Separated as its own concern
- Contains: Repositories, shared services (auth, email)
- Distinction between framework entry points (Frameworks & Drivers) and infrastructure implementation (Infrastructure)
- More aligned with modern microservices and clean code practices

#### 2. Dependency Injection

**Martin's Approach**:
- Shows ports and adapters pattern
- Input/Output ports explicitly diagrammed
- Dependency inversion implied through arrows

**nikolovlazar's Extension**:
- **Explicitly mentions Dependency Injection** as the mechanism ("*achieved through DI")
- Shows Infrastructure Interfaces living in Application layer
- Implementations of these interfaces live in Infrastructure layer
- Makes the inversion mechanism concrete and actionable

#### 3. Infrastructure Interfaces Pattern

**Martin's Approach**:
- Gateway interfaces shown in Interface Adapters ring
- Not explicitly separated from use case layer

**nikolovlazar's Extension**:
- **Infrastructure Interfaces as first-class citizen** within Application layer
- Application layer defines the contracts (interfaces)
- Infrastructure layer provides implementations
- Clear separation of interface definition from implementation
- Enables true testability and substitutability

#### 4. External Dependencies

**Martin's Approach**:
- External systems shown as part of outer ring
- No explicit visualization of how they connect

**nikolovlazar's Extension**:
- **External services explicitly visualized** at the top (Ext.Service, Database)
- Dependency arrows show they depend on Infrastructure layer
- Makes external integration points obvious
- Shows that external systems are consumers, not providers

#### 5. Framework Integration

**Martin's Approach**:
- Generic "Web" and "Devices" in outer ring
- No specific framework guidance

**nikolovlazar's Extension**:
- **Specific framework entry points**: API, server components, server actions, AWS Lambda
- Shows modern web patterns (server-side rendering, serverless)
- Provides concrete guidance for Next.js, serverless architectures
- Multiple framework logos suggest polyglot/multi-framework support

#### 6. Transitive Dependencies

**Martin's Approach**:
- Focused on direct layer-to-layer dependencies
- Implicit transitive access

**nikolovlazar's Extension**:
- **Explicitly annotates "*transitively"** on diagram sides
- Acknowledges that outer layers can access inner layers through multiple hops
- Makes transitive dependency chain explicit for developers

### When to Use Each Diagram

**Use Martin's Diagram When**:
- Teaching Clean Architecture fundamentals
- Explaining dependency inversion principle
- Presenting architecture to non-technical stakeholders
- Framework-agnostic discussions
- Focusing on timeless principles

**Use nikolovlazar's Diagram When**:
- Planning actual implementation structure
- Onboarding developers to a Clean Architecture codebase
- Discussing technology choices and infrastructure patterns
- Explaining Dependency Injection setup
- Working with modern web frameworks (Next.js, serverless, etc.)
- Defining repository layer and data access patterns

### Synthesis for Lean-Clean Methodology

The Lean-Clean Methodology benefits from **both** representations:

1. **P0-P2 (Early Phases)**: Use Martin's diagram for conceptual design and principle communication
2. **P3-P5 (Planning Phases)**: Use nikolovlazar's diagram for implementation planning and epic breakdown
3. **P6 (Execution)**: Use nikolovlazar's diagram as the blueprint for code organization
4. **P8 (Agentic System Design)**: nikolovlazar's Infrastructure layer maps well to observability, monitoring, and alerting infrastructure

**Recommended Pattern for PoCs**:
```
Domain Layer (Entities)
  ↑
Application Layer (Use Cases + Infrastructure Interfaces)
  ↑
Infrastructure Layer (Repositories, Services, External Adapters)
  ↑
Interface Adapters (Controllers, Presenters, CLI handlers)
  ↑
Frameworks & Drivers (FastAPI, Typer CLI, Streamlit UI)
```

This aligns with the proposed app structure in `CLAUDE.md`:
- `app/core/` = Domain + Application layers
- `app/adapters/` = Infrastructure layer
- `app/utils/` = Cross-cutting concerns
- `server.py` = Frameworks & Drivers

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Visualizations (`/acceptance-criteria/`)

### 3.1 The 4 Cs Framework
**File**: `cards-conversation-confirmation-context.png`

**Description**: Visualizes Ron Jeffries' 4 Cs framework for user stories, showing the progression from initial card to verified acceptance criteria.

**The 4 Cs**:
1. **Context (Validation)**: Epic Name, Story Name with domain validation
2. **Card**: "As a <...> I want <...> so that <...>" format
3. **Conversation**: Discussions between stakeholders to agree on details
4. **Confirmation (Verification)**: Acceptance Criteria using Given/When/Then format

**Key Insights**:
- User stories are placeholders for conversations, not complete specifications
- Acceptance criteria are the verification mechanism
- Emphasizes collaboration over documentation
- Visual progression shows the refinement process

**Relevance to Lean-Clean**:
- Maps to **P1 (Decomposition)**: Breaking epics into stories
- Maps to **P3 (Steel Thread)**: Defining minimal testable acceptance criteria
- Maps to **P5 (Implementation Planning)**: Converting stories to executable use-case specs

### 3.2 Given/When/Then Format
**File**: `given-when-then-acceptance-criteria.webp`

**Description**: Detailed example of Given/When/Then acceptance criteria format for a password recovery user story.

**Example Structure**:
```
User story: As a website user, I want to be able to recover the password
            to my account, so that I can access my account in case I forget
            the password

Scenario: Forgot password

Given: The user navigates to the login page
When: The user selects <forgot password> option
And: Enters a valid email to receive a link for password recovery
Then: The system sends the link to the entered email

Given: The user receives the link via the email
When: The user navigates through the link received in the email
Then: The system enables the user to set a new password
```

**Key Features**:
- Multiple Given/When/Then blocks for complex scenarios
- "And" keyword for multiple preconditions or actions
- Clear, testable, unambiguous statements
- Focuses on user perspective and system behavior

**Relevance to Lean-Clean**:
- Direct input for **P5 (Implementation Planning)**: Use-case YAML specs
- Maps to **acceptance_criteria** in use-case definitions
- Enables automated testing in **P6 (Execution)**
- Provides validation hooks for **P8 (Agentic System Design)**

**Proposed YAML Mapping**:
```yaml
use_case:
  name: RecoverPassword
  acceptance_criteria:
    - given: "User navigates to login page"
      when: "User selects forgot password option"
      and: "Enters valid email"
      then: "System sends recovery link to email"
    - given: "User receives link via email"
      when: "User clicks link"
      then: "System enables new password setup"
```

## 4. Lean Product Playbook Visualizations (`/lpp/`)

### 4.1 Product-Market Fit Pyramid (Static)
**File**: `lpp-pyramid-product-market-fit.png`

**Description**: Dan Olsen's Product-Market Fit Pyramid, showing the relationship between market (bottom) and product (top) components.

**Structure** (bottom to top):
- **Market Space**:
  1. **Target Customer** (base)
  2. **Underserved Needs**
- **Product-Market Fit** (bridge between market and product)
- **Solution Space**:
  3. **Value Proposition**
  4. **Feature Set**
  5. **UX** (top)

**Key Insights**:
- Product-Market Fit is achieved at the intersection of market needs and product value
- Foundation must be market understanding (target customer, needs)
- Product layers build upward from value proposition to features to UX
- Each layer must align with the layers below

**Relevance to Lean-Clean**:
- **P0 (Context Framing)**: Defines "why" - maps to Target Customer and Underserved Needs
- **P1 (Decomposition)**: Value Proposition decomposed into minimal feature set
- **P2 (Ideation)**: Exploring solution options for Feature Set and UX
- **P3 (Steel Thread)**: Minimal Feature Set that proves Value Proposition

### 4.2 Lean Product Process (Iterative)
**File**: `lpp-pyramid-the-process.png`

**Description**: The same pyramid with numbered steps (1-6) and a feedback loop showing the iterative nature of achieving Product-Market Fit.

**The 6-Step Process**:
1. **Determine your target customers** (base)
2. **Identify underserved customer needs**
3. **Define your value proposition**
4. **Specify your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set**
5. **Create your MVP prototype**
6. **Test your MVP with customers** (with feedback loop back to step 1)

**Key Features**:
- Circular arrow showing "6. Test with Customers" feeding back to the beginning
- Emphasizes iteration and learning
- Each step is discrete and actionable
- Testing validates all assumptions made in steps 1-5

**Relevance to Lean-Clean Methodology**:
- Direct mapping to **P0-P6 phases**:
  - Steps 1-2 → **P0 (Context Framing)**
  - Steps 3-4 → **P1 (Decomposition)** + **P2 (Ideation)**
  - Steps 4-5 → **P3 (Steel Thread)** + **P4 (Reconstitution)**
  - Step 5 → **P6 (Execution)**
  - Step 6 → **P7 (Reflection)** feeding back to next iteration

- The feedback loop justifies the methodology's emphasis on:
  - **Minimal viable slices** (steel thread)
  - **Iterative learning** (reflection and knowledge capture)
  - **Testing and validation** (acceptance criteria, observability)

**Integration with Clean Architecture**:
- MVP Feature Set (step 4) → Use Cases in Application layer
- Value Proposition (step 3) → Domain entities and business rules
- Prototype (step 5) → Interface Adapters + Frameworks
- Customer Testing (step 6) → Observability and metrics (P8)

## 5. Cross-Cutting Insights

### Thematic Coherence

All image categories support the three pillars of Lean-Clean Methodology:

1. **Lean Product Development** (LPP images):
   - Iterative learning cycles
   - Market-driven feature prioritization
   - Minimal viable validation

2. **Clean Architecture** (CA images):
   - Decoupled layers and testability
   - Dependency inversion for substitutability
   - Infrastructure abstraction

3. **Agentic Design** (implied by infrastructure patterns):
   - Infrastructure layer enables observability hooks
   - Acceptance criteria enable automated validation
   - Repository pattern supports telemetry and monitoring

### Practical Application

**For PoC Development**:
1. Use LPP Pyramid to define MVP scope (**P0-P3**)
2. Use nikolovlazar CA to design implementation structure (**P4-P5**)
3. Use Given/When/Then to define testable acceptance criteria (**P5**)
4. Use Martin CA to communicate architecture to stakeholders (**P7**)
5. Use Infrastructure layer pattern to add observability (**P8**)

**For Documentation**:
- Include LPP pyramid in playbook front matter (context)
- Reference nikolovlazar CA in implementation planning sections
- Embed Given/When/Then examples in use-case YAML templates
- Use Martin CA in methodology documentation and training materials

## 6. Recommendations

### Gap Analysis

**Missing Visualizations**:
1. **Agentic Workflow Diagram**: Visual showing agent watcher, approval flows, and human-in-loop
2. **Phase Flow Diagram**: Visual representation of P0-P8 progression
3. **YAML-Driven Development Flow**: How briefs → playbooks → use-cases → implementation
4. **Observability Stack**: Phoenix + Arize integration with application layers
5. **Steel Thread Visualization**: Minimal end-to-end path through architecture

### Suggested Additions

1. **Create `/images/phases/`**:
   - `lean-clean-phases-overview.png`: Visual timeline of P0-P8
   - `steel-thread-example.png`: Minimal path through architecture

2. **Create `/images/agentic/`**:
   - `agent-watcher-workflow.png`: Inbox → Execution → Approval → Alerts flow
   - `human-in-loop-pattern.png`: Approval gates and validation hooks

3. **Create `/images/implementation/`**:
   - `yaml-driven-development.png`: Brief → Playbook → Use Case → Code flow
   - `observability-integration.png`: How Phoenix/Arize hook into layers

### File Organization

**Current Status**: Good categorical organization

**Recommendations**:
- Consider adding README.md in each subdirectory with brief descriptions
- Add `sources.md` documenting image provenance and licensing
- Create thumbnail versions for documentation embedding
- Add `.gitattributes` to track image LFS if repo grows

---

## 7. Technical Metadata

### Image Formats
- `.jpg`: CA diagrams (photos of whiteboards/presentations)
- `.png`: LPP diagrams, 4Cs framework (digital graphics)
- `.webp`: Given/When/Then example (web-optimized)

### Recommendations
- Convert all to PNG for consistency and better compression
- Maintain source files (if original vectors exist)
- Consider SVG versions for scalability and theme support (dark mode)

### Accessibility
- All images should have alt text when embedded in documentation
- Consider providing text-based alternatives for screen readers
- High contrast versions for low-vision users

---

## 8. Conclusion

The image collection provides strong visual support for the Lean-Clean Methodology's three pillars. The comparison between Martin's and nikolovlazar's Clean Architecture diagrams reveals important extensions that make the methodology more practical for modern development:

1. **Explicit Infrastructure Layer**: Critical for observability, monitoring, and external integrations (P8)
2. **Infrastructure Interfaces Pattern**: Enables testability and adapter substitution
3. **Dependency Injection**: Makes the inversion mechanism concrete and actionable
4. **Modern Framework Integration**: Bridges timeless principles with current technology stacks

These images should be referenced throughout the methodology documentation and used as blueprints for PoC implementation. The combination of abstract principles (Martin) and concrete patterns (nikolovlazar) provides both strategic vision and tactical guidance.
