Phase,Phase Name,Core Question,Key Activities,Expected Outputs,Guiding Prompts
0,Context Framing,Why are we solving this?,"Clarify desired outcome; Identify constraints (time, tech, data); Define success metrics; Draft a north-star hypothesis","Problem statement; Constraints list; Success criteria; Hypothesis","What is the ultimate goal or change desired? What constraints exist? How will success be measured?"
1,Decomposition,What are the atomic parts?,"Break problem into sub-problems; Identify entities, events, relationships; Map inputs → process → outputs; Tag unknowns as experiments","Concept map; Domain model; List of atomic problems and unknowns","What are the smallest meaningful components? Which pieces are unknown or high-risk?"
2,Ideation & Concept Design,How might we solve it?,"Brainstorm solution approaches; Sketch user/system/data flows; Consider analogies and reference architectures; Evaluate feasibility","Candidate solutions; Architecture sketches; Pros/cons matrix; Draft steel-thread candidates","What are 2–3 viable ways to solve this? What tradeoffs exist between them?"
3,Refinement & Steel Thread Definition,What’s the smallest testable slice?,"Score options by impact vs effort; Choose a single end-to-end steel thread; Define validation tests; Trim scope aggressively","Chosen steel thread; Validation plan; Acceptance criteria","What single flow can prove feasibility across all layers once?"
4,Reconstitution & Roadmapping,How does this fit into the bigger picture?,"Translate steel thread into epics/stories; Define roadmap; Revisit architecture boundaries; Identify reuse opportunities","Epic breakdown; Roadmap; Layered architecture outline","How does this proof scale? What dependencies or integrations must exist next?"
5,Implementation Planning,How will we build it cleanly?,"Select frameworks/tools/adapters; Define interface boundaries; Plan test data & environments; Create repo skeleton","Stack decision log; Initial repo structure; Dev plan","Which frameworks or tools best fit constraints? How will you structure boundaries (domain vs infra)?"
6,Execution & Iteration,Can it work in reality?,"Build incrementally; Test and measure; Capture learnings; Iterate","Working PoC; Test results; Insights log","What works, what breaks, what needs rethinking?"
7,Reflection & Knowledge Capture,What did we learn and what’s reusable?,"Document lessons; Update templates; Conduct retrospective; Decide next steps","Retrospective doc; Reusable artifacts; Go/No-Go decision","What should be standardized or improved before scaling or productionization?"
